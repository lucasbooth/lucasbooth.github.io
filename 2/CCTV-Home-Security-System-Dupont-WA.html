<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the maker, instead of at your house) is the standard nowadays, however some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected disk drive.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or 2 in location, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range issues.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
