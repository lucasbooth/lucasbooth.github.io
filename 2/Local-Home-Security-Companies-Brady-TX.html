Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and for how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera connects directly to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
