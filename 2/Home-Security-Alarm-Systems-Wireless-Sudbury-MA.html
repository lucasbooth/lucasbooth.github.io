<h3>Best House Alarm System Sudbury MA 01776</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is discovered. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
