<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we might revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera offers you an outstanding field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more information you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
