Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor client transactions. For example, if a customer claims to have actually purchased a costly item but does not have the invoice, or that an employee was disrespectful or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to figure out whether they were in the store on the day in concern, and what, in truth, occurred.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
