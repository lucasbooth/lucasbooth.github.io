Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by.

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having trouble. This is an easy switch that is normally open or generally closed.
