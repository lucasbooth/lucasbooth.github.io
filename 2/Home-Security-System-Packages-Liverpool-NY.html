Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by.

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom.
