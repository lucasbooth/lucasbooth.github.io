<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business communications were primarily synchronous. To achieve almost anything, someone live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with national and global business. The same is true for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and somebody else, someplace, viewing video surveillance displays for support. Everything is integrated and whatever occurs in real time.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
