<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT likewise has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings.
