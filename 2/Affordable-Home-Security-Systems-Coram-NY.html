In the former, when an alarm goes off, a professional monitoring company receives an alert and after that attempts to call you and, if need be, your local emergency situation services.

That implies you need to be on night, day and call, during work and vacation time, and prepared to identify whether authorities, fire departments, or other emergency situation services need to be dispatched.

Luckily, their regular monthly monitoring cost is on-par with other top brand names.
