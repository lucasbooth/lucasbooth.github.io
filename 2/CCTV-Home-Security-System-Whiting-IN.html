<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction.

Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
