<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested.

The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or four free false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all.

Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security personnel. Several cities also require a permit to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
