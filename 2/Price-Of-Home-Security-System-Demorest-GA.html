<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the web and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>

These sensors can work as part of your security system or on their own, and they differ in size and style from tiny, smooth sensors to obvious and bulky. Sensing units also differ in sensitivity. Some may activate when the door or window vibrates versus in fact opening.</p>
