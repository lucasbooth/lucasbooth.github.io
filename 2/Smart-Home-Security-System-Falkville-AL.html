<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
