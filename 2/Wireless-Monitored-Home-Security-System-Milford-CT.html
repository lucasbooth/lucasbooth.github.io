Audio enhances video surveillance to better find and interpret occurrences in real-time. As an added benefit, an audio option can be quickly incorporated into the existing security system. The audio feed can be transferred utilizing the very same wireless or wired network that transfers the videos - for this reason improving system-wide deployment and distribution choices.</p>
