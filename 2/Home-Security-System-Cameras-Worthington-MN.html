<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
