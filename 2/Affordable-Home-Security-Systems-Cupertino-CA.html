<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>A larger security company that continuously monitors your home will have a designated station that enjoys countless homes and companies at once. They cost more since they need to go through verification with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit organization that focuses on testing product and services to ensure optimum reliability and safety.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
