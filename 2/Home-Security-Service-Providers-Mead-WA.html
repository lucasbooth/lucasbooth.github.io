However, an exception can be made for home security systems that feature advantages like the ADT Mover's Savings Plan, which enable you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends upon the provider, but you can prepare for signing an agreement with providers who require expert installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements might span approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would suggest thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system rather if you desire to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
