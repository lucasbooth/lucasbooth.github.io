The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal construction.

Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
