<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription).

The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
