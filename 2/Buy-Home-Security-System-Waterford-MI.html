Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
