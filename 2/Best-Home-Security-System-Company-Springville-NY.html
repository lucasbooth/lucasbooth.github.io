Expert installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve.
