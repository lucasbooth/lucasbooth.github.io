Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by.
