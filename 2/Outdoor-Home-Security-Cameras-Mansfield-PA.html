If you're not mechanically likely, having actually a professional set up the system may provide you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

And if they wander off into the camera's visual field, you'll receive either an image or short video clip. Some systems can then sound an alarm or contact the emergency situation services, and lots of likewise allow you to talk through the camera.
