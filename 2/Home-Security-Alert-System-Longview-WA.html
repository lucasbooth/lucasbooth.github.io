If the monitoring experts do not get an answer from you or if they get a distress code, they'll rapidly dispatch the police to come and inspect on you.</p>
<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of formal surveillance," suggesting that not just does CCTV have the capability to take the place of cops or security officers but CCTV can also enhance officers' capabilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can inform authorities of crimes as they take place, which can make it possible for officers to respond quickly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011).
