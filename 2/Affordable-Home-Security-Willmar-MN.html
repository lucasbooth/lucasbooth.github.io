<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
