As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<h3>Home And Business Security Systems Breaux Bridge LA 70517</h3>
