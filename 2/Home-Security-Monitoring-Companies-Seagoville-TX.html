<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
