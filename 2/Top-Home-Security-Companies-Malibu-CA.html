<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is spotted. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve.
