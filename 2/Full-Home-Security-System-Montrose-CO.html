When sensing units find motion, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will possibly scare off intruders.

Flood lights can discourage vandals or terrify them away, however as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
