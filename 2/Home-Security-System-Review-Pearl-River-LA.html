<h3>Alarm Security Company Pearl River LA 70452</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest culprit for short battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Valley Alarm has been doing business right here in the Los Angeles area since 1981. So unlike companies based somewhere else, we fully understand the unique security issues facing property owner in our area. Valley Alarm's dedication and know-how in the security market is exhibited by the fact that Valley Alarm's president is also the previous president of the Greater Los Angeles Security Alarm Association and is currently vice president of the California Alarm Association. Our local presence indicates we're able to provide a much higher level of personalized service. At the exact same time, we're recognized as one of the Top 100 security companies in the United States.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
