<p>While every property owner frets about burglaries, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a free smartphone app that allows people who see something suspicious to take a photo and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For instance, a public transit rider might observe somebody acting suspiciously. Lots of people are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a picture of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a few clicks. Reports from smart phone users can be quickly reviewed and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>
<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is focused on the shift to IP video technology, it is very important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly effective for many surveillance applications, particularly those on a budget plan. With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring area. However that does not imply you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
