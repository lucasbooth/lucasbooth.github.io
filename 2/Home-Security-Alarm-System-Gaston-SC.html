<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about.
