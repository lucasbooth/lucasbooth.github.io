<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life without a doubt.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image.

However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in reality, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
