<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it simple to install practically anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have actually become a popular security tool.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
