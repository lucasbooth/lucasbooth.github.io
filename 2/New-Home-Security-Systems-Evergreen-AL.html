And today's indoor security cameras deliver a lot more than recorded video footage. Many feature the choice to view live action video, and cameras with two-way communication let you sign in with kids after school, tell Rover to get off your favorite chair, or terrify the daylights out of someone who does not belong in your home (plus you'll have their photo, to boot!).</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
