<p>In General, Brinks Home Security is a top-notch wireless home security system. It is a perfect option for those trying to find an integrated clever home system.

<p>You can find two types of security systems: professionally monitored and unmonitored. In the previous, when an alarm goes off, a professional monitoring company gets a notification and then tries to contact you and, if requirement be, your local emergency services. An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you. That implies you need to be on day, call and night, during work and getaway time, and prepared to determine whether cops, fire departments, or other emergency situation services require to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge distinction, and a professionally monitored system is fundamentally more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>

Instead, you turn signals on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or activate the siren.
