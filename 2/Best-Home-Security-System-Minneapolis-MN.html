The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and residential or commercial property and not to view people as they jaywalk across the street or run a traffic signal (which both are, by the way, versus the law). Those are different services with various requirements and objectives.</p>

<p>As you simply discovered, there are two broad classifications of security cameras. What you normally find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which normally come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set.

On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
