<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
