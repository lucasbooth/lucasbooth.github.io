Hi there Rebeca, thanks for this blog site. I am so pleased that you have actually discussed about wise home integration Just last week I was offered bunch of cameras to install by a homeowner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. So we had to buy new cameras.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
