<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

Studies have shown that around 70 percent of robberies that are not completed are due to the noise of an alarm. As soon as the cameras were hooked up, we monitored day and night activities, consisting of the comings and goings of two adults, one child, and a dog.

Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
