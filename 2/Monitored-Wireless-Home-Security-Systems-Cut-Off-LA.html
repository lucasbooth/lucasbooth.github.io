Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
