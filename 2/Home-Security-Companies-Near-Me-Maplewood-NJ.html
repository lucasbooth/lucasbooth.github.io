<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to save and the length of time you prepare to keep documented video. The footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
