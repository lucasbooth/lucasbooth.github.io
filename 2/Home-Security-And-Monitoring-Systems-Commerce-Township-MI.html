<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people may find out to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."

<p>We still recommend SimpliSafe general since it has a broader range of equipment and much better cameras.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
