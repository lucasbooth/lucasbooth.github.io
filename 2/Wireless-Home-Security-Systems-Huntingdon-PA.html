Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
