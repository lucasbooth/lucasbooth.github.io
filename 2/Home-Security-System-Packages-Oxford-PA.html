<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away prospective intruders.</p>

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
