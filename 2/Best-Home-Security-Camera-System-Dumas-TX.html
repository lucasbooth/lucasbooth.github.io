<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
