<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a client is having difficulty. This is an easy switch that is normally open or typically closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.
