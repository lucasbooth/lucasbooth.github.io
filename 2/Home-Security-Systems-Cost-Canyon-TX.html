<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Search for a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety as much as 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video.
