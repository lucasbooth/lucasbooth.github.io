<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>C. False Alarm System. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Web, Select either landline or the proper interactive service. Select billing duration: Monthly or Annual. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our yearly customers.
