We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top areas.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
