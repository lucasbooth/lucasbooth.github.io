The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
