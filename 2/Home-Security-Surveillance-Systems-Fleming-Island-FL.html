<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we may revisit this review.
