IP-based cameras carry out the exact same function as analog ones, however with a host of additional capabilities. IP cameras usually offer much better images with greater resolution and more flexibility, allowing users to e-mail video images for assessment. In a big organization with lots of centers, insurer typically choose, and in some cases demand, IP systems.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
