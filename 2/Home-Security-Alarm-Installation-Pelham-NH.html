The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to properly spot motion and not get stuck taping on a loop.
