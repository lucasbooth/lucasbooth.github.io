<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
