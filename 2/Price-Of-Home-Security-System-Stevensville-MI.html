The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
