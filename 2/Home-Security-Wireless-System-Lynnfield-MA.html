Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
