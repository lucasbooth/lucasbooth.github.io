<p>Nationwide Security Corporation has comprehensive experience with style, installation, service and monitoring of intrusion alarm systems in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Google Nest is not understood for being cheap. The Nest Secure system will set you back around $400 for a starter set. If you mean to monitor the system yourself (which is free), that's in fact not too bad. If not, then expert monitoring is likewise a bit costly for this kind of system. And you need to sign an agreement with Brinks to get the most affordable price.</p>
