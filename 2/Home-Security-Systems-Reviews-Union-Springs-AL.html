The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize a violation. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
