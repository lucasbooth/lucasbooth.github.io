<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and in some cases require) professional installation. Expert installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end.

<p>For smart home functions, we recommend the ADT Pulse package. It provides full IFTTT (If This Then That) innovation to let you remotely arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and manage the thermostat so you never have to come home to a chilly house.

Window sensing units are quickly concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensors are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.

Wireless systems are also perfect for renters since they do not need opening the wall, and can easily be taken with you when you transfer to your next location. If you're aiming to enhance your apartment's security, or just want to watch on your place while you're out, think about installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
