<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
