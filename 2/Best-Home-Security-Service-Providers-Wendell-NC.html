A discreet, motion-detecting nanny-cam" style security camera for your kid's room? How about a surveillance system outside your home that captures every angle to protect your household and property?

Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. If you want to watch a large area, you need to consider a camera with a very broad field of vision. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is an excellent possession too.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision choice, however the white and black version can in fact be clearer and give you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a huge deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
