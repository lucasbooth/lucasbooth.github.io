<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by.
