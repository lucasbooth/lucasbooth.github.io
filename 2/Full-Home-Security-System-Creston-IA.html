<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
