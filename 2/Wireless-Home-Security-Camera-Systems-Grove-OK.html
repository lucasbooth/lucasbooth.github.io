The Wyze Web cam can also record video to the cloud, however the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record once again, which means you might be missing a lot. Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not advise that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
