<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a remarkable worth. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage. But the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve.
