If the system was not set up throughout the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power failures. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a blackout, but long term blackouts will lead to the system losing power.
