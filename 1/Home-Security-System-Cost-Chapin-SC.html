Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to keep and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area rapidly.
