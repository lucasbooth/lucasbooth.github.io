<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Alabama</h3>

The camera can record video in approximately 1080p, which looks perfectly fine on a smart device screen and will not tax your internet connection too much.

It has to be plugged in to work-- no battery alternative here, sorry-- but the camera comes with a 25-foot power cable, which ought to assist with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself.
