Continue with care when you're dealing with companies who install exclusive systems and claim that they only work with their licensed monitoring systems.

<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business communications were mostly concurrent. To achieve almost anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with global and nationwide business.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
