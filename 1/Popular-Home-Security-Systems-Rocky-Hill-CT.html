The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
