<p>The Nest Cam IQ includes a built-in Google Assistant and integrates effortlessly with the rest of the Nest home automation suite. It sticks out with an 8x digital zoom function and big 130 ° field of vision. Video quality is likewise great, and this camera can shoot in (compressed) 4K.

The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of tape-recording storage area. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to go with a Do It Yourself system or go with an expertly installed system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or annual  fee if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be hit with a monthly charge to settle the cost of hardware elements.

If you include monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you dedicate to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 each month and does not need a contract.</p>
