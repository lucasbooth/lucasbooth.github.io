<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole family will like. ADT is a household name, so we often experiment with their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with clever smart home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

I guess when compared to the cost of my house, it's a quite cheap rate to pay to keep it protected and safe.</p>

We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Control: Due to the fact that wise alarm systems do not need to involve an alarm monitoring company, the consumer can maintain control. Lots of property owners prefer this level of involvement in monitoring their home security.</p>
