<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
