<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in California</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
