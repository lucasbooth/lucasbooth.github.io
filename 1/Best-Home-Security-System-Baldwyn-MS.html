<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
