The 2nd category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically begins at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a considerably greater rate. The video recorder should be bought individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (United States $) and can range up to $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connectivity, and image processing features.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
