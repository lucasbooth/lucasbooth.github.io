<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten possible robbers.</p>
