<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
