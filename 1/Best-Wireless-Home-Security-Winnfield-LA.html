However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera regularly disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
