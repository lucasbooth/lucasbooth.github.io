Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by.
