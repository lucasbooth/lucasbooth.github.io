<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
