With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
