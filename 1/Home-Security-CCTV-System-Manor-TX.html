<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
