<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and take up a great deal of taping storage space. So much, in fact, that they need about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is important.</p>
