<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
