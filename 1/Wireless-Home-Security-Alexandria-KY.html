These companies developed their equipment this way to make clients stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware.
