However I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I want to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
