If a nefarious crook was fast enough, they could get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them.

<p>However for everyone who likes ADT, it seems like there's someone who's had a terrible experience. Since ADT has more clients than most brands-- which means it has more opportunities to run into issues, part of that is. But part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment. When a company works with several dealers and providers, its clients are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
