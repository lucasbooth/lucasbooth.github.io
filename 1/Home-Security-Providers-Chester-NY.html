<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

Whether its trees, poles or concrete walls, objects blocking the signal strength is definitely something you wish to be aware of and bear in mind if you are buying a wireless system.

The speed test can be performed on a cell phone or laptop computer and will identify where the signal will be strongest.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by.
