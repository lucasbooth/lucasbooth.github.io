<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
