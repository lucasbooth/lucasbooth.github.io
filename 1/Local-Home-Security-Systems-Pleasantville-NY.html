<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
