We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to manage practically every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely customizable.
