<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With decades of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle companies and homes, we have actually constructed fantastic relationships with both local police and their consumers.

The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
