The New Providence Authorities Department is devoted to using every resource to prevent and solve criminal activities and to secure citizens and their home.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an attractive cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
