According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
