<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
