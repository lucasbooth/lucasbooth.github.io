<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and scams. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each response is billed.

If the motion sensors are set off, you can instantly make the smart lights turn on to scare away potential robbers.</p>
