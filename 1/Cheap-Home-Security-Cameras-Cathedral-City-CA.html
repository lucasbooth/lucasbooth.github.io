When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
