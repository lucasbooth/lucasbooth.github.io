<p>Burglar alarms have become basic equipment in shops and other companies, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Life can get chaotic often, and it can be tough monitoring whatever around you. The good news is, a surveillance camera can lend an extra pair of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your family.

The film is often taped and able to be shown and repeated on a monitor.</p>
