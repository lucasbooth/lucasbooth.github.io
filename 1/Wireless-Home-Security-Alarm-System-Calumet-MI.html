<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
