<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that once every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you require to buy a completely new DVR before including another camera to the system.
