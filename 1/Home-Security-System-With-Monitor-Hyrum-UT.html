<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the maker's statistics given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far.
