<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
