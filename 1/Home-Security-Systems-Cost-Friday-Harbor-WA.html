<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. Even so, we believe Protect America's life time warranty on equipment and price-lock assurance make this company a winner to secure your home-- even if it requires a commitment. This model also comes with a smart app that lets you translucent the eyes of your cameras and rapidly record at any time.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs wail, felines squeal, infants sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Monitors can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
