<p>I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have evaluated ratings of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. As a previous editor for Electronic House and Broad View Big Sound, I've written purchasing guides for numerous consumer-electronics products, and I have actually composed short articles covering technology for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's parent company), Wired, Female's Day, Male's Health, and other publications.</p>
