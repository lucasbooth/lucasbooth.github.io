The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night.
