<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a total home security system.

The control panel interacts with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, doors and window sensing units, and motion sensors, to identify an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>
