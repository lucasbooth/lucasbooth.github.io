You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also serves as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can respond to it immediately.
