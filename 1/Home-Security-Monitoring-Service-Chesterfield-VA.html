The response hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and how long you prepare to keep taped video footage. The video is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also serves as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can respond to it immediately.

Given that it is a PIR motion sensor, it only gets set off when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., people and animals. In addition, it does not get triggered by small objects. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most sophisticated motion sensing units that remove all incorrect alarms and just gets set off when people approach it.</p>
