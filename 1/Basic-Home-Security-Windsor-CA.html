<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.
