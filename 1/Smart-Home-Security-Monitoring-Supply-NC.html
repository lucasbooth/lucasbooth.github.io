<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person reaches the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to launch a smart smoke alarm and siren later on this year, which makes this an even much better proposition.</p>

Initially examine the suppliers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>
