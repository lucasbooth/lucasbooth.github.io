Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
