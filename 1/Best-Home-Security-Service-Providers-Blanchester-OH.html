<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
